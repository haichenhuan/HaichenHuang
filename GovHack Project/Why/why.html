      <p class="why"> Parkingmon Go was created for the benefits of those who play Pokemon Go on their phones. People often play Pokemon Go while driving at the same time, because they can't be bothered to walk around. However playing pokemon go while driving is highly dangerous and can result in hefty fines. This is why I have created ParkingMon GO. ParkingMon GO is designed to help Pokemon Go Drivers to find a parking spot. This app however is in beta and can only show parking slots in manuka. This app uses the SmartParking data to find parking slots in Manuka. Now, drivers can find parking spots because they now know where the parking slots are. ParkingMon Go also has a Pokemon Go Slide show. This mechanism is designed to stimulate the minds of the Pokemon Go drivers/players so they can 'Be The Very Best'. Not only does the app offer parking slots in Manuka, but it also shows 'PokéStops' and 'PokéGyms'

			<p class="why">
				This app is for the benefit of all. This will ensure that 'Non-Pokemon Go Drivers' will be safe on the road when driving near Pokemon Go Drivers. This also helps the police because they can have less to do and get paid at the same time for not doing any work! But this website mostly benefits Pokemon Go Drivers, as it will allow them to find parking slots and then catching Pokemon by walking; improving the health of pokemon go drivers. Pokemon Go Drivers using the mind stimulation bit will greatly benefit drivers as it will substantially improve their Pokemon Go decision making and catching ability as they will be "In the Zone"
